# SpringBootAssesment

you have to add more functionalities to ToDo Application. Such as:

1. Create CRUD for ToDos
2. Allowing user to only update the task_status (create a new field taskStatus in your POJO)
3. Adding validations for required cases and throwing string-error response (as of now)
4. Hot to take RequestParam in SpringBoot and have a variant of Get API using PathParam AND RequestParam
Bonus
* Take Param and filter the data and return according to passed Params. EG:
Sort by (ASC/DESC) : on task_id
